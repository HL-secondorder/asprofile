Description: 
    Tools for preparing, modeling, and visualizing in-situ acceleration–speed (A–S)
    profiles from athlete tracking data. The package implements envelope-based
    data reduction, confidence-interval and box-filter cleaning methods, and
    linear A–S model fitting to estimate key performance metrics such as maximal
    acceleration (A0), maximal sprinting speed (S0), slope, and goodness of fit.
    Designed for applied sport science research and athlete monitoring workflows.
